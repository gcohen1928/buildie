# This file makes the 'routes' directory a Python package.
# You can optionally import routers here to make them available when the package is imported,
# but it's often cleaner to let main.py handle individual router imports.

# Example (optional):
# from . import auth, webhook, generate, events
# __all__ = ["auth", "webhook", "generate", "events"]
